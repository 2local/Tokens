## Welcome to the 2Local Repository!

This repository contains the Smart Contracts for building Stellar based token using the Javascript SDK and the horizon testnet, mainnet conversion to follow later!

This token generation and handling has been built in the architecture of an API to allow scale and resonsiveness to happen. Also to allow more users to understand and easily audit the code.

## Cloning and Reusing

The 2Local essentials have been added, allowing for generation and transfer to happen on the testnet.

The application would need a few modifications to perfectly replicate this. A node app to take all these requests and place them into controllers, calling and utilizing them on an open port, be it a test server or a localhost.

## Dependencies

This application would require a few dependencies to run. the following is taken from the application's `package.json` file:

`
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "nodemon": "^1.19.0",
    "request": "^2.85.0",
    "stellar-sdk": "^0.8.0"
  }
  `

This should be enough to build on. For further clarification please email us at notice@2local.io, please use this email for contributions as well!
